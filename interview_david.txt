Interviewer: I would like to start with an important question: Tell me your life story. Start from the beginning - from your childhood, education, family and relationships to all the important events in your life.
David: Well, I was born in Bremen in 1981. My father was a mechanic and my mother worked part-time as a kindergarten assistant. We lived in a modest apartment, but my parents were very loving. I have an older sister, Anna, who I looked up to a lot. School was alright—I wasn’t the best student but I enjoyed history and literature. I studied Business Administration in Hamburg, where I eventually settled down. I met my wife, Miriam, during university, and we’ve been married for 16 years now. We have two daughters, 9 and 12 years old. One big turning point was when I quit my corporate job in 2017 to start my own consultancy. It was risky, but I needed that autonomy.
Interviewer: Some people tell us that at some point in their lives, they reached a turning point... What about you?
David: Yes, that career shift in 2017 was massive. I was on the path to becoming a senior manager, but I felt empty. I remember one evening, stuck in traffic for hours, thinking, is this it? I had a long conversation with my wife that night. We restructured our finances and I quit within three months. Best decision I ever made.
Interviewer: Did you make that decision consciously, or did it just happen?
David: It was very conscious. There was build-up, but the actual moment of decision was very deliberate.
Interviewer: Do you think support would have helped more during that time?
David: Definitely. Mentorship or a startup network could have eased the fear. I had to navigate a lot of unknowns myself.
Interviewer: Let's move on to the present: Tell me more about your family.
David: My wife Miriam works part-time at a library. Our daughters, Emma and Lina, are both in school. Emma loves drawing and Lina is into science. We live in a townhouse in Eimsbüttel, Hamburg.
Interviewer: Who else lives with you?
David: Just the four of us, but my mother stays over during school holidays. She's close to the girls.
Interviewer: Any other close family?
David: My sister lives in Munich. We call each other often, but we don’t meet much in person.
Interviewer: Any close friends or partners?
David: I have three very close friends from university days. We still meet once a month for dinner. They’re like my second family.
Interviewer: Tell me about your neighborhood.
David: It’s green, quiet, and full of young families. Cafés on every corner. People are friendly but not too nosy. I love it.
Interviewer: Do you feel safe there?
David: Absolutely. I’ve never felt unsafe walking at night. It’s one of the reasons we chose this area.
Interviewer: What are the ups and downs of living here?
David: The upside is the quality of life. Downside? Rising rents and traffic are becoming a pain.
Interviewer: What does your daily routine look like?
David: I wake up around 6:30, prepare breakfast for the kids. Drop them off, then work from my home office or meet clients. I try to wrap up by 5:30, cook dinner, and then spend time with family. Weekends are for hiking or board games.
Interviewer: What kind of job do you do?
David: I run a small consultancy focusing on digital transformation for mid-sized companies.
Interviewer: Any other routines?
David: I go jogging every morning and volunteer at a local food bank twice a month.
Interviewer: Any recent changes?
David: During COVID, everything went remote. Now I’m back to a hybrid setup, which I prefer.
Interviewer: What about a typical weekday with kids?
David: Homework support, school projects, weekend sports events. My wife and I take turns doing drop-offs and pick-ups. The kids go to art and science clubs.
Interviewer: Let's move on to political issues. Do you vote?
David: Always. I believe in civic duty. I’ve never missed an election since I was 18.
Interviewer: How would you describe your political views?
David: Center-left. I value social equity and environmental responsibility.
Interviewer: Have your views changed?
David: I used to be more centrist, but the climate crisis and social polarization nudged me leftward.
Interviewer: Now about your health. Tell me anything that comes to mind.
David: I had a knee surgery last year from an old football injury. Other than that, I’m generally healthy.
Interviewer: What makes staying healthy easy or hard?
David: Time. Between work and family, it's tough to keep a regular exercise routine.
Interviewer: Has someone else’s health affected you?
David: Yes, my father’s heart issues in his late 50s made me reevaluate my diet and stress levels.
Interviewer: Have you used alternative medicine?
David: Occasionally. My wife uses acupuncture. I’ve tried it once for back pain.
Interviewer: Do you smoke or drink during hard times?
David: I enjoy a glass of wine on weekends but never smoke. And I don't use alcohol as a coping mechanism.
Interviewer: How do you feel about medical vaccinations?
David: Strongly pro-vaccine. It's a public health issue.
Interviewer: Which sources do you trust?
David: Mostly my GP, the Robert Koch Institute, and peer-reviewed studies. I avoid WhatsApp forwards and social media rumors.
