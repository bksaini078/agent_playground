Interviewer: Some people tell us that at some point in their lives, they reached a turning point where there were several paths open to them, and that their decision then had a significant impact on who they are. What about you? Did you have such a moment, and if so, could you tell me the whole story of it, from start to finish?

Elena Schmidt: Yes, I can think of one significant turning point. It was probably when I decided to leave my permanent position at the tech company in Munich to start freelancing. This was shortly after Lena was born, so around late 2018 or early 2019.

I had a good job, a stable income, and I was well-regarded in the company. The conventional path would have been to return full-time after my parental leave, or perhaps negotiate a more senior part-time role. However, the thought of going back to a rigid 9-to-5 schedule, even if part-time in the traditional sense, felt incredibly daunting with a newborn. I worried about missing out on Lena’s early years and the stress of juggling demanding projects with the unpredictability of a baby.

The other path, the one I chose, was to venture into freelancing. It was a scary prospect. I’d never been self-employed before. There was the uncertainty of finding clients, managing my own finances and insurance, and the lack of a steady paycheck. Stefan and I had many long conversations about it. He was supportive but also understandably concerned about the financial stability. We looked at our savings, calculated our essential expenses, and tried to map out a realistic plan.

The decision process took a few months. I talked to other freelance designers, read a lot about setting up a small business in Germany, and slowly built up the courage. What really tipped the scale was the desire for autonomy and flexibility. I wanted to be able to decide my own hours, choose projects that genuinely interested me, and, most importantly, be there for Lena.

So, I took the leap. I resigned from my job. The first few months were challenging – building a portfolio, networking, learning to price my services. There were moments of doubt, wondering if I’d made the right choice, especially when work was slow. But gradually, things started to pick up. I landed my first few clients, and the positive feedback gave me a huge confidence boost.

Looking back, that decision to go freelance has fundamentally shaped who I am today, both professionally and personally. It taught me resilience, self-discipline, and the importance of trusting my instincts. It allowed me to be the kind of mother I wanted to be while still pursuing my career. It wasn't the easiest path, but it was definitely the right one for me and my family at that time. It made me realize I value freedom and control over my time more than traditional job security.

Interviewer: Some people tell us that they made a conscious choice or decision in moments, while others report that things in their lives "just happened". What about you?

Elena Schmidt: I think it's a mix of both, really. That decision to go freelance was definitely a very conscious choice, involving a lot of deliberation and planning. Moving to Stuttgart with Stefan was also a conscious decision, driven by his career opportunity and our shared desire for a change. Getting married, deciding to have children – those were conscious decisions too, made with intention.

However, there are also things that feel like they "just happened," or perhaps where the path unfolded more organically. For instance, meeting Stefan felt serendipitous; I wasn't actively looking for a partner, it just happened at that party. My initial interest in Communications Design developed gradually through my enjoyment of art and languages in school; it wasn't one single "aha!" moment but more of a slow realization. Even some career opportunities earlier on seemed to arise from being in the right place at the right time, rather than a meticulously planned step. So, yes, a combination of conscious choices and life unfolding.

Interviewer: Do you think that the support of another person or an organization would have helped you in such decision-making moments?

Elena Schmidt: In the case of transitioning to freelance, Stefan's emotional support was absolutely crucial. Without his encouragement and willingness to share the financial risk, it would have been much harder, perhaps impossible. So, personal support was definitely there and immensely helpful.

Regarding organizational support, perhaps more structured mentorship programs for aspiring freelancers, or more accessible government resources for setting up a small business, could have been beneficial. While I found information online, it sometimes felt like navigating a complex maze. Maybe a dedicated advisor or a more streamlined process for the bureaucratic side of things would have eased some of the initial stress. But overall, I managed to find my way.

Interviewer: Let's move on to the present: Tell me more about your family and family members who are important to you. Do you have a partner or children? Who do you live with in the same household? Are you currently married, widowed, divorced, separated or single?

Elena Schmidt: As I mentioned, my immediate family is my husband, Stefan, and our two children. Lena is now 7 years old, and Max is 5. They are, of course, incredibly important to me. Stefan is my partner in every sense of the word; we share everything, the joys and the challenges. We live together in our terraced house here in Stuttgart. And yes, I am currently married to Stefan.

Interviewer: Tell me about the people who live with you at the moment, even those who live with you only temporarily. Are there people who visit regularly / stay in their household?

Elena Schmidt: It’s just the four of us – Stefan, Lena, Max, and myself – living in the household permanently. We don’t have anyone living with us temporarily at the moment. My parents, Hans and Ingrid, visit quite regularly. They still live in Bavaria, so it’s about a two to three-hour drive. They usually come for a weekend every month or two, especially if there’s a special occasion or if we need a bit of extra help with the children. Stefan’s parents live further away, up north, so their visits are less frequent, perhaps two or three times a year, but then they usually stay for a longer period, maybe a week. My brother Markus and his family also visit a few times a year, and we visit them too.

Interviewer: Is there anyone else in your immediate family that you haven't mentioned? Who are these people, and what is your relationship with them?

Elena Schmidt: In terms of my immediate family, that would be my parents, Hans and Ingrid, and my younger brother, Markus. I have a close relationship with my parents. We speak on the phone regularly, at least once or twice a week. They are very loving grandparents to Lena and Max. My brother Markus is married and has a little girl. We get along well; he's always been the more adventurous one. We don't see each other as often as I'd sometimes like, as he lives a few hours away, but we make an effort for family gatherings. Stefan also has a sister, but we are not as close with her, geographically and personally, though we maintain friendly relations.

Interviewer: Tell me about other people in your life that we haven't talked about yet (e.g., friends or love partners). Are there people outside your family who are important to you?

Elena Schmidt: Yes, definitely. I have a few close friends who are very important to me. My best friend, Clara, I’ve known since university in Munich. We’ve been through a lot together, and even though she still lives in Munich, we stay in very close contact – lots of video calls and we try to see each other every few months. Here in Stuttgart, I’ve made some good friends too, mostly through parent groups or local community activities. There’s a small group of mothers from Lena’s old kindergarten class, and we meet up regularly for coffee or with the kids. These friendships are a great source of support and camaraderie.

Interviewer: Now, let's talk about your current residential area. Tell me anything you can think of spontaneously about the neighborhood and the area you live in right now.

Elena Schmidt: We live in a relatively quiet, family-friendly neighborhood in Stuttgart. It’s not right in the city center, more on the outskirts, which we like because it's greener and there’s less traffic. There’s a good primary school nearby, which Lena attends, and a kindergarten for Max. We have a lovely park within walking distance, with a great playground, which is fantastic for the kids. There are also some small local shops – a bakery, a butcher, a little supermarket – so we can get most daily necessities without having to drive far. The connection to public transport is decent, which is important for me if I have client meetings in the city. It has a good community feel; people are generally friendly.

Interviewer: Some people say that they feel very safe in their neighbourhood, others tend not to feel so safe. What about you?

Elena Schmidt: I feel very safe here. It’s one of the reasons we chose this area. It’s a calm neighborhood, and I’ve never felt uneasy, even when walking alone in the evening. There’s a sense of community watchfulness, too; people know their neighbors, which I think contributes to the feeling of security.

Interviewer: Life in any place has its ups and downs. Tell me what it's like for you to live here.

Elena Schmidt: Overall, it's very positive. The main "ups" are the family-friendly environment, the green spaces, the good schools, and the general sense of safety and community. It’s a good place to raise children. The proximity to my work when I need to go into the city is also a plus.
The "downs" are perhaps minor. Sometimes I miss the vibrancy and cultural offerings of a bigger city like Munich, especially the art scene. Housing prices in Stuttgart are also quite high, which was a factor when we bought our house. And like any city, traffic can be an issue if you need to drive during peak hours, but we try to use public transport or cycle when possible. But these are small things compared to the overall quality of life we have here.

Interviewer: What does your daily routine look like in a normal week?

Elena Schmidt: Oh, a normal week is quite structured, especially with the children. On weekdays, I’m usually up around 6:30 AM. I try to have a quick coffee and check my emails before the kids wake up around 7:00 AM. Then it’s the morning rush – getting Lena and Max ready for school and kindergarten, making breakfast, packing lunch boxes. Stefan usually leaves for work around 7:30 AM, and I walk Lena to school and Max to kindergarten around 8:00-8:15 AM.

Once I’m back home, usually by 8:45 AM, my workday begins. As a freelancer, my work hours are flexible, but I try to maintain a routine. I usually work intensely from around 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM, focusing on client projects, design work, or calls. I’ll have a quick lunch, and then it’s time to pick up Max from kindergarten around 2:00 PM, and Lena from her after-school care around 3:30 or 4:00 PM.

The afternoons are usually dedicated to the children – homework with Lena, playing, going to the park, or taking them to their activities. Lena has ballet once a week, and Max goes to a little sports group.
Stefan usually gets home between 6:00 and 7:00 PM. We have dinner together as a family. After dinner, it’s bath time for the kids, stories, and then bedtime for them by around 8:00 or 8:30 PM.
Once the children are asleep, Stefan and I might catch up on our day, watch some TV, or I might do another hour or two of work if I have a deadline or feel particularly inspired. I try to wind down by 10:30 PM and head to bed by 11:00 PM.
Weekends are different, more relaxed. We try to do family outings, visit friends or family, or just have some downtime at home.

Interviewer: What kind of job(s) do you do, and when do you work?

Elena Schmidt: As I mentioned, I’m a freelance UI/UX designer. This means I design user interfaces and experiences for websites, mobile apps, and other digital products. My work involves understanding user needs, creating wireframes and prototypes, designing visual elements, and collaborating with developers. I work from my home office.
My work hours are mostly during the school/kindergarten hours, so roughly from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM on weekdays. Then, often I’ll do another hour or two in the evening after the children are in bed, or sometimes on a weekend morning if there's a pressing deadline. The flexibility is key; if one of the children is sick, I can adjust my schedule, but it also means work can sometimes spill into evenings and weekends.

Interviewer: Do you have any other routines or responsibilities that you haven't mentioned before?

Elena Schmidt: Well, beyond the work and childcare, there are the usual household responsibilities. I do most of the cooking during the week. Stefan and I share the cleaning, grocery shopping, and general household admin. I try to squeeze in some exercise a couple of times a week, maybe a jog in the park or an online yoga class, but that can be a bit hit-or-miss depending on how busy the week is. I also manage the family finances and appointments. And, of course, trying to maintain contact with extended family and friends, organizing playdates for the kids – the mental load that often comes with running a household and family.

Interviewer: Tell me about all the recent changes in your daily routine.

Elena Schmidt: The most recent significant change was Max starting kindergarten full days last autumn. Before that, he was only there for half days, so it gave me a bit more uninterrupted work time in the mornings. Lena also started second grade last September, which means a bit more homework and a slightly different school schedule. There haven't been any hugely drastic changes in the last few months, more like the usual seasonal adjustments – more outdoor time now that it's spring and heading into summer, compared to the winter months. My workload as a freelancer also fluctuates, so some weeks are more intense than others, which impacts the routine slightly.

Interviewer: If you have kids, tell me about a typical weekday during the week. What does your daily routine look like? And what leisure activities do your children take part in?

Elena Schmidt: I think I covered most of the typical weekday routine already. The mornings are about getting them ready and off to school and kindergarten. My work happens while they are there. After I pick them up, Lena might have some homework to do. Then it's playtime, which could be at home with their toys, drawing, or if the weather is nice, we'll go to the local park or our garden.
As for leisure activities, Lena does ballet once a week on Tuesdays. She really enjoys it. Max is in a general children's sports group ("Kindersport") on Thursdays, which involves a lot of running around, climbing, and playing games. It's great for his energy levels! On weekends, we sometimes take them swimming, or visit a museum suitable for children, or go for a hike in the nearby forests. We also encourage them to play creatively at home, building things with Lego, drawing, or making up stories.

Interviewer: Let's move on to political issues: Some say they take part in every election, others say they don't go to the polls as a matter of principle. How is it with you?

Elena Schmidt: I make it a point to vote in every election, whether it's federal, state, local, or European elections. I believe it's an important civic duty and a privilege. It’s our way of participating in the democratic process and having a say in how our society is run, even if it sometimes feels like one vote doesn't make a huge difference. I still think it's crucial to exercise that right.

Interviewer: How would you describe your political views?

Elena Schmidt: That's a big question! I would describe my political views as generally centre-left. I believe in a strong social safety net, environmental protection, and social justice. I think it's important for the government to play a role in ensuring equal opportunities, especially in education and healthcare. I value policies that support families and promote sustainability. I’m generally pro-European integration. I believe in a society that is open, tolerant, and inclusive. I’m not affiliated with any particular political party, but my views tend to align most closely with parties that emphasize these values, like the Greens or the SPD (Social Democratic Party), depending on the specific issues. I try to stay informed about different perspectives and make my decisions based on policies rather than blind party loyalty.

Interviewer: Tell me if your political views have changed recently.

Elena Schmidt: I wouldn't say my core values have changed dramatically recently, but perhaps my focus on certain issues has sharpened. For instance, with the increasing visibility of climate change impacts, environmental policies and sustainable living have become even more important to me than they were, say, ten years ago. Also, becoming a parent has definitely made me more attuned to issues around education, childcare, and family support. I find myself thinking more about the kind of world we are leaving for our children. So, it's more an evolution and a shifting of priorities based on life experiences and current events, rather than a radical change in my fundamental political orientation. The political discourse in recent years, with increased polarization, has also made me more reflective about the importance of dialogue and finding common ground.

Interviewer: Now we would like to know more about your health. First of all, tell me everything about your health that comes to mind spontaneously. Have there been any events in recent years that have affected your state of health?

Elena Schmidt: Generally, I consider myself to be in good health, thankfully. I try to eat relatively well, stay active when I can. The biggest events affecting my physical health in recent years were, of course, the pregnancies and births of Lena and Max. Those are major physical undertakings! Recovery from childbirth took time, as it does for most women. Beyond that, I haven't had any serious illnesses or injuries. Like most people, I get the occasional cold or flu, especially with young children bringing germs home from school and kindergarten. Sometimes, the stress of juggling work and family can lead to tension headaches or feeling a bit run down, but I try to manage that with rest and self-care when possible.

Interviewer: What makes it easy or hard for you to stay healthy?
