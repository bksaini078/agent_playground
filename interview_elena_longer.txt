Interviewer: Some people tell us that at some point in their lives, they reached a turning point where there were several paths open to them, and that their decision then had a significant impact on who they are. What about you? Did you have such a moment, and if so, could you tell me the whole story of it, from start to finish?

Elena Schmidt: Yes, I can think of one significant turning point. It was probably when I decided to leave my permanent position at the tech company in Munich to start freelancing. This was shortly after Lena was born, so around late 2018 or early 2019.

I had a good job, a stable income, and I was well-regarded in the company. The conventional path would have been to return full-time after my parental leave, or perhaps negotiate a more senior part-time role. However, the thought of going back to a rigid 9-to-5 schedule, even if part-time in the traditional sense, felt incredibly daunting with a newborn. I worried about missing out on Lena’s early years and the stress of juggling demanding projects with the unpredictability of a baby.

The other path, the one I chose, was to venture into freelancing. It was a scary prospect. I’d never been self-employed before. There was the uncertainty of finding clients, managing my own finances and insurance, and the lack of a steady paycheck. Stefan and I had many long conversations about it. He was supportive but also understandably concerned about the financial stability. We looked at our savings, calculated our essential expenses, and tried to map out a realistic plan.

The decision process took a few months. I talked to other freelance designers, read a lot about setting up a small business in Germany, and slowly built up the courage. What really tipped the scale was the desire for autonomy and flexibility. I wanted to be able to decide my own hours, choose projects that genuinely interested me, and, most importantly, be there for Lena.

So, I took the leap. I resigned from my job. The first few months were challenging – building a portfolio, networking, learning to price my services. There were moments of doubt, wondering if I’d made the right choice, especially when work was slow. But gradually, things started to pick up. I landed my first few clients, and the positive feedback gave me a huge confidence boost.

Looking back, that decision to go freelance has fundamentally shaped who I am today, both professionally and personally. It taught me resilience, self-discipline, and the importance of trusting my instincts. It allowed me to be the kind of mother I wanted to be while still pursuing my career. It wasn't the easiest path, but it was definitely the right one for me and my family at that time. It made me realize I value freedom and control over my time more than traditional job security.

Interviewer: Some people tell us that they made a conscious choice or decision in moments, while others report that things in their lives "just happened". What about you?

Elena Schmidt: I think it's a mix of both, really. That decision to go freelance was definitely a very conscious choice, involving a lot of deliberation and planning. Moving to Stuttgart with Stefan was also a conscious decision, driven by his career opportunity and our shared desire for a change. Getting married, deciding to have children – those were conscious decisions too, made with intention.

However, there are also things that feel like they "just happened," or perhaps where the path unfolded more organically. For instance, meeting Stefan felt serendipitous; I wasn't actively looking for a partner, it just happened at that party. My initial interest in Communications Design developed gradually through my enjoyment of art and languages in school; it wasn't one single "aha!" moment but more of a slow realization. Even some career opportunities earlier on seemed to arise from being in the right place at the right time, rather than a meticulously planned step. So, yes, a combination of conscious choices and life unfolding.

Interviewer: Do you think that the support of another person or an organization would have helped you in such decision-making moments?

Elena Schmidt: In the case of transitioning to freelance, Stefan's emotional support was absolutely crucial. Without his encouragement and willingness to share the financial risk, it would have been much harder, perhaps impossible. So, personal support was definitely there and immensely helpful.

Regarding organizational support, perhaps more structured mentorship programs for aspiring freelancers, or more accessible government resources for setting up a small business, could have been beneficial. While I found information online, it sometimes felt like navigating a complex maze. Maybe a dedicated advisor or a more streamlined process for the bureaucratic side of things would have eased some of the initial stress. But overall, I managed to find my way.

Interviewer: Let's move on to the present: Tell me more about your family and family members who are important to you. Do you have a partner or children? Who do you live with in the same household? Are you currently married, widowed, divorced, separated or single?

Elena Schmidt: As I mentioned, my immediate family is my husband, Stefan, and our two children. Lena is now 7 years old, and Max is 5. They are, of course, incredibly important to me. Stefan is my partner in every sense of the word; we share everything, the joys and the challenges. We live together in our terraced house here in Stuttgart. And yes, I am currently married to Stefan.

Interviewer: Tell me about the people who live with you at the moment, even those who live with you only temporarily. Are there people who visit regularly / stay in their household?

Elena Schmidt: It’s just the four of us – Stefan, Lena, Max, and myself – living in the household permanently. We don’t have anyone living with us temporarily at the moment. My parents, Hans and Ingrid, visit quite regularly. They still live in Bavaria, so it’s about a two to three-hour drive. They usually come for a weekend every month or two, especially if there’s a special occasion or if we need a bit of extra help with the children. Stefan’s parents live further away, up north, so their visits are less frequent, perhaps two or three times a year, but then they usually stay for a longer period, maybe a week. My brother Markus and his family also visit a few times a year, and we visit them too.

Interviewer: Is there anyone else in your immediate family that you haven't mentioned? Who are these people, and what is your relationship with them?

Elena Schmidt: In terms of my immediate family, that would be my parents, Hans and Ingrid, and my younger brother, Markus. I have a close relationship with my parents. We speak on the phone regularly, at least once or twice a week. They are very loving grandparents to Lena and Max. My brother Markus is married and has a little girl. We get along well; he's always been the more adventurous one. We don't see each other as often as I'd sometimes like, as he lives a few hours away, but we make an effort for family gatherings. Stefan also has a sister, but we are not as close with her, geographically and personally, though we maintain friendly relations.

Interviewer: Tell me about other people in your life that we haven't talked about yet (e.g., friends or love partners). Are there people outside your family who are important to you?

Elena Schmidt: Yes, definitely. I have a few close friends who are very important to me. My best friend, Clara, I’ve known since university in Munich. We’ve been through a lot together, and even though she still lives in Munich, we stay in very close contact – lots of video calls and we try to see each other every few months. Here in Stuttgart, I’ve made some good friends too, mostly through parent groups or local community activities. There’s a small group of mothers from Lena’s old kindergarten class, and we meet up regularly for coffee or with the kids. These friendships are a great source of support and camaraderie.

Interviewer: Now, let's talk about your current residential area. Tell me anything you can think of spontaneously about the neighborhood and the area you live in right now.

Elena Schmidt: We live in a relatively quiet, family-friendly neighborhood in Stuttgart. It’s not right in the city center, more on the outskirts, which we like because it's greener and there’s less traffic. There’s a good primary school nearby, which Lena attends, and a kindergarten for Max. We have a lovely park within walking distance, with a great playground, which is fantastic for the kids. There are also some small local shops – a bakery, a butcher, a little supermarket – so we can get most daily necessities without having to drive far. The connection to public transport is decent, which is important for me if I have client meetings in the city. It has a good community feel; people are generally friendly.

Interviewer: Some people say that they feel very safe in their neighbourhood, others tend not to feel so safe. What about you?

Elena Schmidt: I feel very safe here. It’s one of the reasons we chose this area. It’s a calm neighborhood, and I’ve never felt uneasy, even when walking alone in the evening. There’s a sense of community watchfulness, too; people know their neighbors, which I think contributes to the feeling of security.

Interviewer: Life in any place has its ups and downs. Tell me what it's like for you to live here.

Elena Schmidt: Overall, it's very positive. The main "ups" are the family-friendly environment, the green spaces, the good schools, and the general sense of safety and community. It’s a good place to raise children. The proximity to my work when I need to go into the city is also a plus.
The "downs" are perhaps minor. Sometimes I miss the vibrancy and cultural offerings of a bigger city like Munich, especially the art scene. Housing prices in Stuttgart are also quite high, which was a factor when we bought our house. And like any city, traffic can be an issue if you need to drive during peak hours, but we try to use public transport or cycle when possible. But these are small things compared to the overall quality of life we have here.

Interviewer: What does your daily routine look like in a normal week?

Elena Schmidt: Oh, a normal week is quite structured, especially with the children. On weekdays, I’m usually up around 6:30 AM. I try to have a quick coffee and check my emails before the kids wake up around 7:00 AM. Then it’s the morning rush – getting Lena and Max ready for school and kindergarten, making breakfast, packing lunch boxes. Stefan usually leaves for work around 7:30 AM, and I walk Lena to school and Max to kindergarten around 8:00-8:15 AM.

Once I’m back home, usually by 8:45 AM, my workday begins. As a freelancer, my work hours are flexible, but I try to maintain a routine. I usually work intensely from around 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM, focusing on client projects, design work, or calls. I’ll have a quick lunch, and then it’s time to pick up Max from kindergarten around 2:00 PM, and Lena from her after-school care around 3:30 or 4:00 PM.

The afternoons are usually dedicated to the children – homework with Lena, playing, going to the park, or taking them to their activities. Lena has ballet once a week, and Max goes to a little sports group.
Stefan usually gets home between 6:00 and 7:00 PM. We have dinner together as a family. After dinner, it’s bath time for the kids, stories, and then bedtime for them by around 8:00 or 8:30 PM.
Once the children are asleep, Stefan and I might catch up on our day, watch some TV, or I might do another hour or two of work if I have a deadline or feel particularly inspired. I try to wind down by 10:30 PM and head to bed by 11:00 PM.
Weekends are different, more relaxed. We try to do family outings, visit friends or family, or just have some downtime at home.

Interviewer: What kind of job(s) do you do, and when do you work?

Elena Schmidt: As I mentioned, I’m a freelance UI/UX designer. This means I design user interfaces and experiences for websites, mobile apps, and other digital products. My work involves understanding user needs, creating wireframes and prototypes, designing visual elements, and collaborating with developers. I work from my home office.
My work hours are mostly during the school/kindergarten hours, so roughly from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM on weekdays. Then, often I’ll do another hour or two in the evening after the children are in bed, or sometimes on a weekend morning if there's a pressing deadline. The flexibility is key; if one of the children is sick, I can adjust my schedule, but it also means work can sometimes spill into evenings and weekends.

Interviewer: Do you have any other routines or responsibilities that you haven't mentioned before?

Elena Schmidt: Well, beyond the work and childcare, there are the usual household responsibilities. I do most of the cooking during the week. Stefan and I share the cleaning, grocery shopping, and general household admin. I try to squeeze in some exercise a couple of times a week, maybe a jog in the park or an online yoga class, but that can be a bit hit-or-miss depending on how busy the week is. I also manage the family finances and appointments. And, of course, trying to maintain contact with extended family and friends, organizing playdates for the kids – the mental load that often comes with running a household and family.

Interviewer: Tell me about all the recent changes in your daily routine.

Elena Schmidt: The most recent significant change was Max starting kindergarten full days last autumn. Before that, he was only there for half days, so it gave me a bit more uninterrupted work time in the mornings. Lena also started second grade last September, which means a bit more homework and a slightly different school schedule. There haven't been any hugely drastic changes in the last few months, more like the usual seasonal adjustments – more outdoor time now that it's spring and heading into summer, compared to the winter months. My workload as a freelancer also fluctuates, so some weeks are more intense than others, which impacts the routine slightly.

Interviewer: If you have kids, tell me about a typical weekday during the week. What does your daily routine look like? And what leisure activities do your children take part in?

Elena Schmidt: I think I covered most of the typical weekday routine already. The mornings are about getting them ready and off to school and kindergarten. My work happens while they are there. After I pick them up, Lena might have some homework to do. Then it's playtime, which could be at home with their toys, drawing, or if the weather is nice, we'll go to the local park or our garden.
As for leisure activities, Lena does ballet once a week on Tuesdays. She really enjoys it. Max is in a general children's sports group ("Kindersport") on Thursdays, which involves a lot of running around, climbing, and playing games. It's great for his energy levels! On weekends, we sometimes take them swimming, or visit a museum suitable for children, or go for a hike in the nearby forests. We also encourage them to play creatively at home, building things with Lego, drawing, or making up stories.

Interviewer: Let's move on to political issues: Some say they take part in every election, others say they don't go to the polls as a matter of principle. How is it with you?

Elena Schmidt: I make it a point to vote in every election, whether it's federal, state, local, or European elections. I believe it's an important civic duty and a privilege. It’s our way of participating in the democratic process and having a say in how our society is run, even if it sometimes feels like one vote doesn't make a huge difference. I still think it's crucial to exercise that right.

Interviewer: How would you describe your political views?

Elena Schmidt: That's a big question! I would describe my political views as generally centre-left. I believe in a strong social safety net, environmental protection, and social justice. I think it's important for the government to play a role in ensuring equal opportunities, especially in education and healthcare. I value policies that support families and promote sustainability. I’m generally pro-European integration. I believe in a society that is open, tolerant, and inclusive. I’m not affiliated with any particular political party, but my views tend to align most closely with parties that emphasize these values, like the Greens or the SPD (Social Democratic Party), depending on the specific issues. I try to stay informed about different perspectives and make my decisions based on policies rather than blind party loyalty.

Interviewer: Tell me if your political views have changed recently.

Elena Schmidt: I wouldn't say my core values have changed dramatically recently, but perhaps my focus on certain issues has sharpened. For instance, with the increasing visibility of climate change impacts, environmental policies and sustainable living have become even more important to me than they were, say, ten years ago. Also, becoming a parent has definitely made me more attuned to issues around education, childcare, and family support. I find myself thinking more about the kind of world we are leaving for our children. So, it's more an evolution and a shifting of priorities based on life experiences and current events, rather than a radical change in my fundamental political orientation. The political discourse in recent years, with increased polarization, has also made me more reflective about the importance of dialogue and finding common ground.

Interviewer: Now we would like to know more about your health. First of all, tell me everything about your health that comes to mind spontaneously. Have there been any events in recent years that have affected your state of health?

Elena Schmidt: Generally, I consider myself to be in good health, thankfully. I try to eat relatively well, stay active when I can. The biggest events affecting my physical health in recent years were, of course, the pregnancies and births of Lena and Max. Those are major physical undertakings! Recovery from childbirth took time, as it does for most women. Beyond that, I haven't had any serious illnesses or injuries. Like most people, I get the occasional cold or flu, especially with young children bringing germs home from school and kindergarten. Sometimes, the stress of juggling work and family can lead to tension headaches or feeling a bit run down, but I try to manage that with rest and self-care when possible.

Interviewer: What makes it easy or hard for you to stay healthy?

Elena Schmidt: What makes it easy is that I genuinely enjoy healthy food, like fresh fruits and vegetables, and I like being outdoors. Living in an area with access to parks and nature helps. My husband, Stefan, is also health-conscious, so we support each other in making good choices, for example, cooking healthy meals together.
What makes it hard is primarily lack of time and sometimes stress. When I'm very busy with work deadlines or the kids are particularly demanding, it’s easy for exercise to fall by the wayside, or to reach for quicker, less healthy convenience foods. Sleep can also be compromised when I'm stressed or the kids are unwell, and lack of sleep definitely impacts my overall well-being and energy levels. Finding that consistent time for dedicated exercise or meal prep can be a real challenge with a young family and freelance work.

Interviewer: Sometimes one's life is not only influenced by one's own health, but also by that of a loved one. Has that ever been an issue for you?

Elena Schmidt: Yes, to some extent. My father, Hans, had a heart scare a couple of years ago. He needed a minor procedure and had to make some lifestyle changes. It was a very worrying time for all of us, especially for my mother. It made me more aware of his health and the importance of cherishing the time we have with our loved ones. It also prompted more conversations within our family about health and preventive care. Thankfully, he recovered well and is doing much better now, but it was a stark reminder of how interconnected our well-being is. And, of course, when the children are sick, even with common childhood illnesses, it affects the whole family – sleepless nights, worry, and juggling care with other responsibilities.

Interviewer: Have you or your immediate family ever used alternative forms of medicine? These can include homeopathic, non-Western or healing forms of treatment.

Elena Schmidt: We primarily rely on conventional Western medicine, especially for serious conditions. However, I am open to some complementary approaches. For minor ailments, like colds or a child's restlessness, I might occasionally use homeopathic remedies, if recommended by a trusted source or our pediatrician who is open to it. For instance, for the children, our pediatrician has sometimes suggested gentle homeopathic options alongside conventional advice. I’ve also tried things like herbal teas for relaxation or to aid sleep. I see these more as supportive measures rather than primary treatments for significant health issues. Stefan is generally more skeptical of anything outside mainstream medicine. My mother is a bit more into herbal remedies and has always had a home pharmacy of natural treatments for minor things.

Interviewer: Some people tell us that they smoke or drink during difficult times. How is it with you?

Elena Schmidt: I don't smoke, and I never have. Regarding alcohol, I might have a glass of wine in the evening sometimes to unwind, perhaps on a Friday after a long week, or socially with friends. But I wouldn't say I turn to alcohol specifically during difficult times as a coping mechanism. If I'm very stressed or upset, alcohol often makes me feel worse, not better. I'm more likely to talk things through with Stefan or a friend, go for a walk, or try to get some extra rest if I'm feeling overwhelmed.

Interviewer: Some people are enthusiastic about medical vaccinations, others not so much. How is it with you?

Elena Schmidt: I am generally pro-vaccination. I believe they are a very important public health measure. Both Lena and Max have received all the standard childhood vaccinations recommended by the STIKO (Standing Committee on Vaccination) in Germany. Stefan and I also keep our own vaccinations up to date, like tetanus or flu shots. I see it as a responsibility not only for our own health but also for protecting vulnerable people in the community.

Interviewer: Which sources of information about vaccination do they consider trustworthy?

Elena Schmidt: My primary source of information is our pediatrician and my general practitioner. I trust their medical expertise and advice. I also look at information from official public health institutions like the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) and the Federal Centre for Health Education (BZgA). I try to rely on scientific evidence and recommendations from reputable medical organizations rather than anecdotal stories or information from less credible sources on the internet.

Interviewer: Now we would like to talk a little more about what your life was like in the last year. Tell me all about what you experienced and how it made you feel.

Elena Schmidt: The last year – let’s see, from around May 2024 to now. It’s been a pretty full year, a typical mix of busy family life and work. A big thing was Max starting his last year of kindergarten, getting ready for school this coming autumn. That brought a mix of excitement and a little bit of nostalgia, seeing him grow up so fast. Lena has been thriving in her second year of school, really enjoying reading and making new friends.
Work-wise, my freelance business has been steady. I had a couple of challenging but rewarding projects. There were periods of intense work and tight deadlines, which can be stressful, but also a sense of accomplishment when things go well.
Emotionally, it’s been mostly stable. The usual ups and downs of parenting – the joy of seeing the kids achieve milestones, the frustration of toddler tantrums or sibling squabbles. There were definitely moments of feeling tired and stretched thin, trying to balance everything. But also many moments of happiness and gratitude for our family and our life here. We managed a lovely family holiday last summer, which was a great way to recharge. Overall, I’d say it was a year of steady progress and growth, without any major upheavals.

Interviewer: Tell me about a situation in the last year when you were in a difficult situation or in which you were struggling emotionally.

Elena Schmidt: There was a period last autumn, around October or November. I had a particularly demanding client project with a very tight deadline, and at the same time, both children came down with a nasty flu, one after the other. Max was quite unwell for over a week, with high fevers and sleepless nights. Lena got it just as he was recovering. Trying to care for two sick, miserable children while also needing to deliver high-quality work on schedule was incredibly stressful. I felt torn, exhausted, and guilty – guilty that I couldn't give my full attention to the children, and guilty that I was struggling to meet my work commitments. There were a few days where I barely slept, just working late into the night after the kids were finally settled. I definitely felt emotionally drained and overwhelmed during that time. Stefan was as supportive as he could be, but he also had his own work pressures. It was one of those periods where you just have to grit your teeth and get through it.

Interviewer: Some people say they struggle with depression, anxiety, or similar problems. How is it with you?

Elena Schmidt: I wouldn't say I struggle with clinical depression or a diagnosed anxiety disorder. However, like many people, I do experience periods of stress and anxiety, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed by responsibilities, like the situation I just described. Sometimes, the pressure of freelancing – the uncertainty of future projects, managing finances – can cause some anxiety. And the general worries about the children’s well-being or the state of the world can weigh on my mind. I try to manage these feelings by talking about them, ensuring I get enough rest when possible, and trying to maintain a sense of perspective. If I ever felt these feelings were becoming persistent or unmanageable, I would definitely seek professional help.

Interviewer: (if "yes") How has it been for your family?

Elena Schmidt: Well, since I don't have a diagnosed condition, it's more about how my stress or worry affects the family. When I'm very stressed, I can be less patient or more irritable, which isn't fair to Stefan or the children. I try to be mindful of that. Stefan is usually very understanding and will often pick up on when I'm struggling and encourage me to take a break or talk about what's bothering me. We try to support each other through those more difficult patches.

Interviewer: What role do religion and spirituality play in your life? Which religious community do you feel you belong to?

Elena Schmidt: I was raised Catholic, baptized and confirmed. We went to church somewhat regularly when I was a child, especially for major holidays. However, as I got older, I drifted away from organized religion. Today, I wouldn't describe myself as actively religious in the traditional sense of attending church services regularly or adhering strictly to all church doctrines. I don't feel I belong to a specific religious community now.
However, I do consider myself to have a spiritual side. I find a sense of peace and connection in nature, in art, and in meaningful human relationships. I believe in values like kindness, compassion, and striving to be a good person. While I don't follow a formal religion, I do reflect on the bigger questions in life and try to live in a way that feels authentic and purposeful. For our children, we've decided to teach them about different beliefs and values, focusing on moral education rather than a specific religious upbringing, allowing them to form their own views as they grow older. We do celebrate cultural holidays like Christmas and Easter, more for the family traditions and the values of togetherness and renewal they represent for us.

Interviewer: Some people tell us that they use Facebook, Instagram, or other social media to stay connected to the world. What about you? Tell me how you use such platforms.

Elena Schmidt: Yes, I do use some social media, though I try to be mindful of how much time I spend on it. I use Instagram a bit, mostly to follow other designers for inspiration, some parenting accounts, and to share occasional family photos with close friends and relatives who are further away. I have a Facebook account, largely to stay in touch with older contacts or for local community groups where information about neighborhood events or recommendations are shared. I also use LinkedIn for professional networking, to keep up with industry trends and connect with potential clients or collaborators. I try to avoid getting sucked into endless scrolling or comparing myself to others, which I think can be a downside of social media. I see it more as a tool to use intentionally rather than a constant presence.

Interviewer: Some people say that they use social networks to get (emotional or financial) support during difficult times. How is it with you?

Elena Schmidt: I wouldn't typically turn to broad social networks for deep emotional support during difficult times. For that, I rely on my close personal relationships – Stefan, my best friend Clara, my parents, or other close friends. I might share general frustrations or seek light-hearted advice in smaller, private WhatsApp groups with other mothers I know.
For professional support, LinkedIn can be useful for advice or industry insights. Financially, no, I wouldn't seek support through general social media platforms. If we were in a dire situation, we would turn to family or look into official support systems first.

Interviewer: Tell me if your stress levels, worries, and emotional coping strategies have changed recently.

Elena Schmidt: I think my general stress levels have been fairly consistent over the past year, with the usual peaks and troughs related to work and family life. The worries tend to revolve around the children's development and well-being, financial security as a freelancer, and broader societal issues like climate change or economic instability.
In terms of coping strategies, I've become more aware of the importance of setting boundaries, particularly with work, though it's an ongoing learning process as a freelancer. I'm trying to be better at recognizing early signs of stress and proactively doing something about it, whether it’s taking a short break, going for a walk, or simply acknowledging that I need a bit more rest. Talking things through with Stefan remains a key coping mechanism. Perhaps I'm a little more conscious now of trying to carve out small moments for myself, even if it's just 15 minutes with a cup of tea and a book, as that can make a difference to my overall emotional state.

Interviewer: Now we want to talk about your financial situation and what the monthly budget looks like for you and your family. What were your biggest expenses last month?

Elena Schmidt: Last month, so April 2025. Our biggest single expense was definitely the mortgage payment for our house. That’s a fixed, significant amount every month. After that, it would be groceries and household supplies for a family of four – that adds up quickly. Then, utilities – electricity, gas, water, internet. And because it was April, we also had some higher expenses related to car insurance and vehicle tax, which are due annually or semi-annually for us. So, mortgage, food, utilities, and those annual car-related bills were probably the biggest chunks.

Interviewer: How much did your household spend last month? Is that the usual amount? And if not, how much do you usually spend and on what?

Elena Schmidt: Last month, with those car-related annual payments, it was probably a bit higher than average. I would estimate our total household spending for April was around 4,500 to 5,000 Euros.
Our usual monthly spending, without those larger irregular bills, is probably closer to 3,800 to 4,200 Euros. The main recurring expenses are the mortgage (around 1,500 Euros), groceries (around 800-900 Euros), utilities (around 300-400 Euros), health insurance contributions (as a freelancer, I pay my share, and Stefan has his through his employer but there are still some out-of-pocket things), transport costs (petrol, public transport tickets, around 200-250 Euros), and then expenses for the children like kindergarten fees for Max (Lena’s school is public but there are still costs for materials or excursions), clothes, and their activities (around 200-300 Euros). The rest would be for personal spending, savings, insurance, and miscellaneous things.

Interviewer: Invoices can change over the course of a year. The seasons change, there are holidays and special events, school starts and ends, and so on. Tell me how your expenses have changed over the past year.

Elena Schmidt: Yes, they definitely fluctuate. Over the past year, we saw higher heating costs during the winter months, so our utility bills were up from roughly November to March. Then, summer usually means slightly lower utility bills but perhaps more spending on leisure activities, like day trips or our family holiday last summer, which was a significant expense. Christmas is always a more expensive time with gifts and festive food. Back-to-school costs for Lena in September, for new supplies and clothes, also cause a bit of a bump. My freelance income can also fluctuate, which means sometimes we are more careful with discretionary spending if it’s been a leaner month for me. We also had some unexpected home repair costs last year – the dishwasher broke down and needed replacing, which wasn't planned. So it’s a constant adjustment.

Interviewer: Are you the owner or tenant of your apartment?

Elena Schmidt: We are the owners of our terraced house.

Interviewer: Who is jointly responsible for rent, mortgage or other household expenses with you?

Elena Schmidt: My husband, Stefan, and I are jointly responsible for the mortgage and all other household expenses. We have a joint bank account from which most of our shared expenses are paid.

Interviewer: Tell me how you've coped with additional costs over the past few months.

Elena Schmidt: When additional, unexpected costs come up, like the dishwasher repair I mentioned, we usually cover them from our savings if possible. We try to maintain a small emergency fund for such situations. If it’s a larger, anticipated additional cost, like the annual car insurance, we budget for it in advance. Sometimes, if my freelance income has been good, that provides a bit of a buffer. If things were really tight, we would cut back on non-essential spending – eating out less, postponing purchases of clothes or other discretionary items – until we are back on track.

Interviewer: Some people have a savings account, others save in a different way, and still others say they don't save. How is it with you?

Elena Schmidt: We do save. We have a traditional savings account (Tagesgeldkonto) where we keep our emergency fund and short-term savings. We also try to put a bit of money aside each month into longer-term investments, like ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds), for our retirement and for the children's future education. It’s not always a huge amount each month, especially with the rising cost of living, but we try to be consistent.

Interviewer: Some people save for big things, such as a house, while others save for bad times. How was it for you (last year)?

Elena Schmidt: Last year, our saving was a bit of a mix. We continued to contribute to our emergency fund – saving for "bad times" or unexpected expenses. We also kept putting money into our long-term investments, which is more like saving for big future goals like retirement or future larger expenses. We didn't have a specific very large purchase we were saving for last year, like a new car, but more generally building financial security and planning for the future. We also tried to save a bit specifically for our summer holiday so it wouldn't impact our regular budget too much.

Interviewer: Some people have student loans or credit card debt. Others borrow money from family, friends, or find other ways to borrow money. Tell me about all the debts you are currently paying off.

Elena Schmidt: Our main debt is the mortgage on our house. We took that out when we bought the house about eight years ago, and it’s a long-term commitment we are steadily paying off. We don’t have any student loans; thankfully, the university system in Germany is structured in a way that we both managed to graduate without accumulating debt. We do have credit cards, but we use them for convenience and pay off the balance in full each month, so we don't carry any credit card debt. We haven't borrowed money from family or friends. So, just the mortgage.

Interviewer: Tell me about a moment last year when you didn't have enough money to buy something or pay a bill that was due.

Elena Schmidt: Thankfully, we haven't had a situation last year where we couldn't pay an essential bill that was due. We manage our finances carefully to avoid that. There might have been moments where we decided to postpone a non-essential purchase – perhaps a new piece of furniture we were considering, or a more expensive weekend trip – because funds were a bit tighter that month due to an unexpected expense or a slower month for my freelance work. But for essential bills, we’ve always managed. It’s something we prioritize very highly.

Interviewer: What is or was your profession? What activities are part of your work and what are your most important tasks?

Elena Schmidt: My profession is a UI/UX Designer. As a freelancer, I work with various clients to design digital products like websites and mobile applications. My activities include conducting user research to understand the needs and pain points of the target audience. Then, I create user flows, wireframes, and interactive prototypes to map out the structure and functionality of the product. A significant part is the visual design – creating an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface, choosing typography, colours, and imagery. I also conduct usability testing to get feedback and iterate on the designs. Collaboration is key, so I work closely with clients, project managers, and sometimes developers. My most important tasks are to ensure that the final product is intuitive, accessible, and meets both user needs and business goals.

Interviewer: How are you employed, fixed-term or permanent? Is your employment contract regulated by or based on a collective agreement?

Elena Schmidt: As a freelancer, I am self-employed. I don't have a permanent or fixed-term employment contract with one employer. Instead, I work on a project basis for different clients, usually based on individual service contracts (Dienstleistungsverträge or Werkverträge) for each project. These contracts are not typically regulated by collective agreements; the terms are negotiated individually.

Interviewer: How many weeks did you work in the past year (for a few hours, including paid vacation, sick days, and military service)?

Elena Schmidt: As a freelancer, the concept of "paid vacation" or "sick days" is different. If I don't work, I generally don't get paid. However, I did take about four weeks off for a family holiday last summer and a few additional days around Christmas and Easter. There were also perhaps a week or two in total throughout the year where I couldn't work much due to one of the children being sick, or myself not feeling well. So, if I estimate the weeks I was actively working on client projects, it would probably be around 44 to 46 weeks in the past year, with varying hours per week.

Interviewer: How many hours per week did you usually work?

Elena Schmidt: It really varies depending on the projects I have. On average, I aim for about 20-25 billable hours per week. Some weeks it might be less, around 15-20, if I'm between projects or it's a slower period. Other weeks, if I have tight deadlines, it could be more, maybe 30-35 hours. That doesn't include administrative time for my business, like invoicing, marketing, or professional development.

Interviewer: Have you worked in a job or company for pay (even just for an hour) in the past week?

Elena Schmidt: Yes, definitely. As a freelancer, I was working on client projects last week.

Interviewer: How many jobs have you worked in the last month, including part-time, evening, or weekend work? What jobs were these?

Elena Schmidt: In the last month, April 2025, I was actively working on projects for two different clients. Both were UI/UX design projects. One was an ongoing project for a software company, helping them refine the user interface of a new product. The other was a shorter-term project for a small business, designing their new website. All my work is freelance UI/UX design.

Interviewer: How much money did you receive for your work or activity in the last month?

Elena Schmidt: My freelance income varies month to month. For last month, April 2025, after deducting business expenses but before taxes, my income was around 3,200 Euros. Some months are better, some are a bit lower.

Interviewer: How often do you get paid?

Elena Schmidt: It depends on the client and the project structure. For some longer projects, I might invoice monthly. For shorter projects, I might invoice at specific milestones or upon completion of the project. So, it's not a fixed payday like in traditional employment; payments come in at different times throughout the month or year.

Interviewer: How much did your household earn in total last month?

Elena Schmidt: Between my freelance income and Stefan's salary from his engineering job, our total gross household income last month (April 2025) was approximately 9,000 Euros, before taxes and social security contributions. After all deductions, our net income would be closer to 5,500 - 6,000 Euros.

Interviewer: Tell me more about your workplace. How long have you been in your current job? How would you describe the benefits and (financial) benefits associated with your work? (This could include things like additional health benefits, company car, job bike, childcare).

Elena Schmidt: My workplace is my home office. I've been freelancing for about six and a half years now, since late 2018. The main benefit of freelancing is the flexibility in terms of working hours and location, which is invaluable with young children. I also have the autonomy to choose the projects I work on and to shape my own career path.
Financially, the benefit is that I can potentially earn more per hour than in some employed roles, though this is offset by the lack of paid holidays, sick leave, and employer contributions to pensions or health insurance (I have to cover these myself). There are no traditional employment benefits like a company car, job bike, or employer-subsidised childcare. However, I can deduct certain business expenses for tax purposes, which is a financial benefit. The biggest non-financial benefit is definitely the work-life balance it can offer, though it requires good self-management.

Interviewer: How would you describe your relationships in the workplace? (What is your relationship with your supervisor? How are your relationships with your colleagues?)

Elena Schmidt: As a freelancer working from home, I don't have a traditional workplace with supervisors or colleagues in the same way an employee would. My "relationships in the workplace" are primarily with my clients. I strive to build collaborative and professional relationships with them, based on clear communication and trust. For each project, I interact with project managers, product owners, or business owners. I also network with other freelance designers online or at industry events, and these relationships can be very supportive and collegial, even if we don't work together directly on projects. It's more of a peer network.

Interviewer: Tell me how predictable your working hours are. How would you describe your work in terms of flexibility in your working hours?

Elena Schmidt: My working hours are not entirely predictable in the long term, as they depend on client projects and deadlines. Some periods are busier than others. However, on a day-to-day or week-to-week basis, I have a high degree of flexibility. I can largely decide when I work, as long as I meet deadlines and am available for scheduled meetings with clients. This means I can structure my workday around school and kindergarten pick-up times, or shift hours if a child is sick. So, high flexibility, but with that comes the responsibility of managing my own time effectively to ensure unpredictability in workload doesn't become overwhelming.

Interviewer: (only for people with children) Did you have difficulties finding or keeping a job because of your children's care situation?

Elena Schmidt: That was a major factor in my decision to go freelance in the first place. When Lena was a baby, the thought of returning to my previous employed role, even part-time, felt challenging given the childcare needs and the desire for more flexibility. Finding high-quality, flexible childcare that aligns perfectly with traditional working hours can be difficult. So, rather than trying to fit our family life into a rigid job structure, I chose a career path that allowed me to build my work around our family's needs. Freelancing mitigated many of those potential difficulties, though it came with its own challenges, of course.

Interviewer: How would it be for you if you had to spend 400 euros on an emergency? Would you have the money, and if not, how would you get it?

Elena Schmidt: Yes, we would have the money. We maintain an emergency fund specifically for unexpected expenses like that, so 400 Euros would be manageable from our savings without causing major financial strain.

Interviewer: How do you assess your financial situation overall?

Elena Schmidt: Overall, I would assess our financial situation as stable and comfortable, but not extravagant. We own our home, which is a significant asset, though it comes with a mortgage. We manage our expenses carefully, we save regularly, and we don't have consumer debt. Stefan has a secure job with a good income, and my freelance work contributes significantly to our household finances and gives us more flexibility. We can afford a good quality of life, provide for our children, and enjoy occasional holidays. We are not wealthy, and we still need to be mindful of our budget, especially with rising costs, but we feel financially secure. There's always a bit of underlying concern about long-term financial planning, especially retirement, given I'm a freelancer, but we are actively working on that.
